Use Scikit-learn/Keras to build a machine learning system based on the dataset you imported. You can use any combination of models we looked at in class: parametric models, linear/polynomial regression, logistic regression, neural networks, support vector machines, or trees. You may also use dimensionality reduction techniques. Lastly, you can also use clustering (k-means) if you are familiar with this technique. For classification models: be sure to print the results of your model using a classification matrix, precision and recall scores, and model loss (when these are applicable). For regression models, be sure to show the MSE or RMSE. You should implement a minimum of two contrasting techniques.
